This file contains data on longitude/latitude of Mars under "opposition" with the Sun, in the
ecliptic coordinate system.

1. Columns A/B/C/D/E are year/month/day/hour/minute of the opposition.
2. Columns F,G,H,I denote the ZodiacIndex, Degree, Minute, Second, respectively, of Mars's (heliocentric) longitude in the ecliptic coordinate system. ZodiacIndex refers to the zodiac (Aries 0, Taurus 1, ..., Pisces 11).
3. Longitude = ZodiacIndex*30 + Degree + Minute/60 + Second/3600 (degrees)
4. Columns J,K refer to degree, minute of the geocentric latitudinal position of Mars in the ecliptic coordinate system.
5. Columns L,M,N,O refer to Mars's mean longitude, with reference to Kepler's approximated equant. Instead of using this, you will find these based on your own equant.
